**Class 1 Notes**

<p>I find Markdown to be an extremely useful tool for notetaking, as well as fascinating regarding the possibilities it allows. I have always struggled taking notes via computers in the past, whether it be too unorganized or Wordâ€™s forceful structure. I believe that being able to personalize my own journal for note taking will be much more conducive to notetaking. 
</p>
<p>Markdown is very intuitive and easy to learn, especially if you are comfortable with utilizing the correct syntax. Even more enticing is the vast list of commands at my disposal while taking notes. Another aspect of using GitHub pages I find valuable is the ability to format, customize and create your own experience. This is extremely useful later when recalling previous notes. For example, creating an inline table of contents with a direct link to every page of your notes as apposed to flipping through material is much more efficient.
</p>
<p>I plan on using this new tool moving forward to organize my studies in a format which best suites me. Now that I am more comfortable with it, I would like to delve into a personal page to manage all my work.
