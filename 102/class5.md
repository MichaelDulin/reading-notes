**Class 5 Notes**

**What is CSS?**
- Cascading Style Sheets
  - Styles code outlined by HTML
    - Allows for sectioning of page
    - Provides more tools to detail
    - Allows changing of color and size
- Syntax:
  - Selector:
    - Selects HTML *element* to sytle
    - EX: h1 is header 1, then call color: red; = turns font red
    - Uses curly brackets like higher level languages
  - Inside the brackets we have a *declaration*
    - Can take the form of *property* and *value* pairs
    - EX: color is the *property*
    - EX: red is the *value* 
- Modules:
  - Language is broken down into *modules*
  - A module specifies which part of the page we are organizing
    - EX: Background and Borders 
- CSS Specifications
  - developed by W3C called CSS Working Group     

**How to Add CSS**
- Three ways to insert CSS:
  - External CSS
    - Can change the look of an entire website by changing one file
    - External styles defined as: *<link rel=stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">*
    - Can be written in any text editor and must save with .css extension (NO HTML TAGS)
  - Internal CSS
    - Used if one *single* HTML page has a unique style
    - Defined inside <style> element inside <head>
  - Inline CSS
    - Used to apply a unique style for a *single* element
    - Inline styles can contain any CSS property
  - Hierarchy:
    - 1. Intline Style (inside an HTML element)
    - 2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
    - 3. Browser Default
