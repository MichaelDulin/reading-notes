**Class 4 Notes**

**Wireframe and Design**
- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers tp define and plan their design
  - provides an outline of your program / what to expect
- Using the outline, we can sketch where we would like certain elements on a page 
- Tools for wireframing
  - UXPin
    - clickable protorypes in browser
  - InVision
    - Allows feedback from your team directly to mock-up
  - Wireframe.cc
    - Allows the user to quickly create a wireframe in browser
  - You can also frame by hand  
- Steps:
  - Research who is going to be using this, why are they using this and what sort of audience to expect
  - Organize research for quick reference 
  - Maintain a flow map to visualize the users experience and manipulation of the program
  - Rememeber this is going to be a rough draft / focus on the program funcionality itself
  - After you have finished the previous steps, now worry about the detail and aesthetics 
  - Turn wireframe into a prototype
- Key Principles:
  - Clarity
  - Confidence
  - Simplicity

**Mozilla HTML Basics**
- HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
  - A markup language used to structure your content
  - Consists of a series of elements and enclosing tags
- Anatomy of HTML element
  - Opening tag
    - consists of name of element wrapped in angle brackets <p>
  - Closing tag
    - Same as opening tag but with a forwards slash </p>
  - Content 
    -  Content between tags
  - Element
    - The entirety of opening tag, closingtag and content
- Anatomy of HTML document 
  - <!DOCTYPE html> is the preamble
  -  <html></html> all content must be wrapped in this
  -  <head></head> acts as a container for all the things we don't want the user to see
  -  <meta charset="utf-8"> sets chracter set for document ti UTF-8 (most written languages)
  -  <meta name-"viewport" content="width=device-width"> viewport element / ensures the page renders at the width of viewpoint
  -  <title></title> title element, title which appears in browser tab when the page is loaded
  -  <body></body> contains ALL content thatyou want the user to see 

**Semantics**
- Refers to the meaning of a piece of code
- in HTML, symantics refer to code with a value attached to it
- HTML should be coded to represent the data that will populate
- Benefits of using semantic markup:
  - Search engines will consider its content important 
  - Helps with the visually impaired 
  - Easier to find meaningful blocks of code 
  - Semantic naming mirrors proper element naming
