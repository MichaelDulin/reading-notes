**Class 7 Notes**

**MDN Control Flow**
- Control Flow:
  - order in which computers operate
  - lines of code execute consecutively
  - must consider program structures to determine what will execute
- Typical script include:
  - control structures:
    - loops
    - functions  
    - conditionals  

**JS Function**
- Function:
  - Block of code designed to perform a particular task
  - invoked when 'called'
- Syntax:
  - defined by 'function' keyword
    - includes the name of function
    - contains arguments to be inherited
    - EX: function name(parameter1, parameter2) {}
  - Invoked when it is called 
- Return:
  - after function is called, it returns the value of arguments passsed 
- Functions allow us to reuse code 
- Allows the use of imbedded functions such as .toUpperCase();      

**JS Operators**
- Assigns value to a variable
- EX:
  - =, =, *, +
  - follows PEMDAS
