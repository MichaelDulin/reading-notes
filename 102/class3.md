**Class 3 Notes**

<p> Using a Version Control System (VCS) is a necessity in the programming world. It provides tools such as project version tracking, the ability to modify other peoples' code and provides backups for files. There are 3 types of VCS that have been used:
</p>

- Local Version Control
  - one database on a local hardrive 

- Centralized Version Control
  - A single server which holds your culminating code 

- Distributed Version Control
  - best: provides mirrored repositories which can backup and revert in the event of a crash 
  - Git is a DVCS

<p> Git provides a non-linear development with multiple branches and and can support large packages. Through Git I am able to keep track of all my projects on a single server which will maintain and store my code. While an individual may start their program on VS, GitHub or any other third party software, git is universal in its control / manipulation of code. This makes adding, pushing and pulling easy and streamlined. Utilizing ACP is a great practice for developers as it ensures a consistent way to upload, download and edit your code. ACP stands for add, commit and push. These are the three main commands used when using git. Git add . will add work done, committing will finalize the content make and push will upload all the changes to your repository on GitHub.
