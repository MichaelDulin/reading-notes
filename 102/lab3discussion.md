# Lab 03 Reflection

<p> Having used Github before (minimally and without direction), I feel much more comfortable using it now. I have used terminal before to manipulate code but that too was much more difficult. What is the most appealing aspect of using Github with VS and terminal is the amount of control I have over file pathing. Pushing from VS has proven difficult before, however, by using the terminal, I can see exactly which files have been saved, which files I am missing and if there are any discrepencies. Another appealing aspect of using VS for markdown is the ability to view the "result" simultaniously as writing it.
