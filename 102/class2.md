**Class 2 Notes**

<p>A text editor is a software that you can utilize for writing and managing test, used predominantly for building websites. While there are many text editors out there, there is no best. Rather, it is a matter of opinion so long as it proves the necessary tools required. According to The Older Coder in his article *Choosing A Text Editor* When looking for the best software to fit your personal needs, it is best to consider certain features, such as:   
</p>

- Syntax highlighting
- Variety of themes
- Selection of extensions avaiable 
- Code completion 

<p>While there are some text editors that are provided on your pc, they do not offer many of the aforementioned qualities. Rather, third-party products typically are designed to address all of these. Regardless, whichever editor you settle on requires its own learning curve.
