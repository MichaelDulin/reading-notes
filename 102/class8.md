**Class 8 Notes**

**Expressions and Operators**
- Expression
  - valid unit of code that resolves to a value
  - types:
    - Side effects: assigns a value
    - evaluate
  - EX: x = 7
    - assigns the value of 7 to x
- Assignment operators:
  - How the data is being manipulated
  - EX:
    - x = f()
    - x += f()
    - x %= f() 
  - assignments to properties applies w/ obejct 
  - used to assign datatype to something else
    - TRY NOT TO CHAIN ASSIGNMENTS
- Comparison Operators:
  - compares two operands and returns logical value - bool
  - EX:
    - ==
    - !=
    - ===
    - !== 
  - Note: === is strict / == is not strict
    - == will compare string to number
    - === will not     

**Loops and Iterations**
- Loops:
  - Repeat code until desired value is met
- for loop:
  - Evaluates until condition evaluates to false
  - 3 parts of for loop:
    - Initializing expression: creates local variable (incrementor)
    - Condition Expression: Evaluates code within loop until parameter is met
    - Statement: Increments local variable each loop  
- while loop:
  - Executes as long as specified condition evaluates to true
  - Does not *need* an incrementor
