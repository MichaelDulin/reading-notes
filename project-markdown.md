Each of us will choose work we specifically dont want to do in order to get better at those tasks, and we will also do code review every day in the mornings to make sure we know what one anothers code is doing
  
## Conflict Plan
1. What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - be 100% honest with one another, take group votes, and have good project prep in order to not have conflicts in the first place

  - part of being 100% with one another, and if the other two think that way that person owes the rest of the team coffee, also distribute tasks evenly
3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - code reviews, if someone isn't understanding something then the other two help that person understand what's going on in the code
4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - be 100% with each other, we each agree that every one of us will put in 100% effort in this project, so if that person isn't contributing it means they're lagging behind in understanding the code and the rest of the group will try to help them understand. If that is going hard then we will incorporate remo T/A's or Michael Treat in helping that person understand what's going on

5. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - same way, text, discord
6. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

    - all 3
  b. Who merges PRs?
    - anyone who is the last person to review

    - to our secondary branch every morning we will review pull request and then as a group merge to secondary branch, for main we will do it once our secondary is running the way we want
  d. How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
    - its a given, every morning we know what our first step is
  
## Project Idea Pitches
1. Project Wingman 
  - A site which stores different project ideas
  - A single place to house all of our project ideas as well as the ability to upload / create a new project. This allows us to better plan new projects as well as access all our previous ideas or previous projects.
  - MVP:
    - add new project -> automatically upload to database
    - delete projects
    - get / display all projects
    - update existing projects
    - ability to sign into personal account
    - API: bored API         
  
2. Shit Manager
  - A customizable database for the user to store their personal commodities, hobbies, URL's to products they frequently use
  - Ex: As a user, I would like to save specifications on products I frequently use or items I know I may need in the future 
  - MVP:
    - Add / delete new or existing items
    - Get and display items 
    - Updating new items
    - ability to sign in 
    - API: chucknorrisfacts
