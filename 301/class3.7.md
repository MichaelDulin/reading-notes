**How I explained REST to my brother**
1. Who is Roy Fielding?
  - He helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  - We have not been utilizing servers or API's, rather, we have been coding statically for the most part
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  - It acts as a address where we can pull anything from anywhere on the web
4. What does a GET do?
  - Fetches resources -> returns data to user
5. What does a POST do?
  - Used for adding something to another system
6. What does PUT do?
  - Used for replacing something in another system
7. What does PATCH do?
  - Similar to PUT but only a partial update
