**Resources from Class 4**
- [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
- [The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)
- [React Bootstrap - Forms](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/forms/overview/)
- [React Docs - conditional rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

**React Docs - Forms**
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  - An input whose value is controlled by React by controlling what happens on subsequent use input after the form is rendered 
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
  - We update right away by making the form the only state handler
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  - It will be the same value passed to form this.state.value

  
**The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained**
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
  - They are cleaner, shorter and more readable than if statements
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

  if(x===y){
    console.log(true);
  } else {
    console.log(false);
  }
  - x===y ? true : false;
