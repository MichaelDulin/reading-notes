**Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack**
1. What is a ‘call’?
  - The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
  - One call is handled at a time
3. What does LIFO mean?
  - Last in, First out
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
  - 
5. What causes a Stack Overflow?
  - A function with no end

  
**JavaScript error messages**
1. What is a ‘reference error’?
  - Wrong data path / no data to deliver
2. What is a ‘syntax error’?
  - Essentially a 'typo'
3. What is a ‘range error’?
  - A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value.
4. What is a ‘type error’?
  - Incompatible value type 
5. What is a breakpoint?
  - A point in our code which we can stop at when executing to 'step' through each line of code in succession
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
  - The process of fixing errors in code
