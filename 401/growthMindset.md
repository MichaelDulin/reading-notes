**Emotional Intelligence**
 
Emotional intelligence is incredibly important, not just as an individual, but within the workplace. There are certain aspects to emotional intelligence that if ignored can directly impact your life and ability to find a job. Being able to monitor ones emotions as well as understand where they may be rising from is something we all work on throughout the entirety of our lives. I personally have experience this growth throughout mine. For instance, the way I go about thinking about issues and problems has evolved entirely. Another example of how I know I have grown in this sense is my response to outside stimuli, whether this be another person or situation.
  
**Biases**

Biases exist everywhere. I feel that as an individual, my perspective on different opinions, backgrounds and cultures has been fairly unbiased in the past. I believe this stems from being in the military previously. There truly is a unique aspect of being in the military which is being able to meet and interact with such a vast variety of people, especially when we are all suffering together. Nothing really brings people together like group misery. I also spent 2.5 years stationed in Japan, roughly an hour from Tokyo. This was an extremely eye opening experience for me as it was by far the longest time I have spent living in a different country. Having the opportunity to connect / experience other cultures is an incredibly powerful experience.
