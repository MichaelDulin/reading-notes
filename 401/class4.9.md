**Resources from Class 9**
- [Read todayâ€™s Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-09/lab/)
- [Review API Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/api-server/)
- [Review Auth Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/auth-server/)

**Project Ideas**
1. Game Tracker
  - An online tracker of boardgames which can be played assisted or unassisted. Users will be required to sign in via auth, be able to view high scores, invite friends (other users) and create custom gaming experiences. All users will be able to create new games, read scores and delete previous custom made games. Admin will be able to add or delete permanent game titles as well as alter user data / status.
2. Merchandise Sales
  - An app which can be used universally in variety of settings, in which users (streamers / youtubers / actual stores) can easily display their products. As an overlay, this can take user data already authorized from whichever platform they're on. Users will have minimal privleges while admin users can add / delete items.
