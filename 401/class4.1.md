**Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com**
1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
  - Node is a cross-platform and easy-to-use tool that allows our programs written in JavaScript to do many things at the same time, in different order using certain words or values we use to assign function called a callback. We can use this to view our program.
2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
  - A Runtime Environment (RTE) is essentially a program which provides the functionality needed for a program to run. JavaScript is most commonly executed in a browser. 
3. What is Node used for?
  - Using Node, we can execute JavaScript code without a browser, merging both front and back, allowing us to write entire programs in just JavaScript
