**An Introduction to NodeJS and Express**
1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
  - A middleware function has all the access for requesting an object (stored data).
2. Express the most popular __ .
  - Backend Frameworks for Node.js
3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
  - This means we can do many things in a variety of ways using express as it is very versatile 
4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
  - A module allows us to store functionality which can be used as needed throughtout the Node.js application

  
**What is NPM?**
1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
  - 9.5.1
2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
  - npm i jshint


**What is TDD?**
1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
  - With tests, we can make sure our code works. It is important because it allows us to easily make sure what we write is working and speeds up production time.
2. What are three expected benefits of testing
  - Reduction in defect rates
  - While start up is slow, it significantly reduces effort in final phases
  - Increased final quality
3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
  - Individual: forgetting to test frequently and writing too many tests at once
  - Team: poor maintence of test suite and only a few devs on the team using them

**CI/CD**
1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
  - Minimizes scope of errors, allowing for easy debugging
  - Allows for a quicker release of final product, speeding up production speed
  - Allows for contiunout feedback from customers and dev members being easily ammendable / implementable
2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
  - Continuous Delivery refers to constantly pushing / updating code which gets tested automatically, while Continuous Deployment refers to automatic releasing of any dev changes.
3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
  - GitHub essentially is the handler regarding all of these changes, or the 'middle man'
