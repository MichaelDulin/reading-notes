**AWS S3**
1. What is Amazon S3?
  - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
2. Name some use cases for Amazon S3.
  - Running cloud-native applications and building data lakes.
3. Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.
  - Backup and restoration of data as well as archiving data at a low cost.

  
**AWS Lambda Basics**
1. What is AWS Lambda?
  - A serverless computing service provided by AWS, Lambda allows users to create functions and self contained applications, upload them and will execute said functions
2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.
  - Scalabale APIs: Lambda can serve http requests, can split up different routes of an API and scales APIs to their most optimal performance.
  - Data processing: Lambda functions are optimized for event-based data processing. It is easy to integrate AWS Lambda with datasources like Amazon DynamoDB and trigger a Lambda function for specific kinds of data events. 
3. Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.
  - Serverless refers to utilizing certain tools which expedite our coding process by automatically implementing certain key elements needed.


**CDN**
1. What is a CDN?
  - Content Delivery Network: geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?
  - Utilizing several geographical data points, caches data in several servers around the world which lowers latency and increases the scope of a users potential load. 
3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?
  - Helps protect against cyber attacks 
  - Increases user load times and lowers latency/ping
  - Divides workload from one server to handling more appropriate requests based on geographical locations
  - Extremely beneficial if user-base is worldwide
