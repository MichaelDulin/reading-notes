  - Using the navigation panel, upon clicking on EC2, you will find the different instances
2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
  - T2 is an unlimited instance sustaining high performing CPU performance: the difference in sizes dictates the scale of use of an application
3. Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
  - First we fetch a CPU instruction (machine language)
  - Decode the instruction
  - Access operands 
  - Perform opporation


**Elastic Beanstalk**
1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?

2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
  - EC2 allows for creating servers in AWS cloud while Elastic Beanstalk 
3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
  - Timesaving server configuration, powerful customization and cost-effective price point
