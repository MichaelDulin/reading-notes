**Reflection**

The article "The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of" from the "Ethics in the Workplace" resources presents an individual's reflection on his part in creating a website that provided potentially harmful information to vulnerable individuals. It exposes the ethical dilemma tech professionals can face: just because we can build something, does it mean we should? The story stood out because it showed the deep regret one can feel when ethics aren't thoroughly considered in the tech development process. I agree with the author's final note about instilling a sense of ethical responsibility in developers. It underscores the need for teaching and enforcing ethical considerations in the tech field.

Moving to the "Ethics in Technology" section, the article "The Ethical Dilemmas of Self-Driving Cars" from The Globe and Mail discusses the thorny issue of programming automated vehicles to make split-second, potentially life-saving decisions. This directly ties into the ethical dimensions in technology: how do we infuse morality into machines? The striking aspect of this piece was the real-life implications of these decisions, potentially determining who lives and who dies in a crisis. I find myself in agreement with the article, as it showcases the critical importance of ethical decision-making in the design and programming of autonomous vehicles. It reinforces the concept that ethics is not just an abstract consideration in tech development but has tangible, real-world impacts.
