**Discussion**
1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
  - I think being in this field on and off for several years has given me a pretty analytical mind. I also have an extensive medical / patient care background, and feel like I can connect with User needs well.
2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
  - One thing I have learned to really appreciate throughout this course is taking breaks. This is a great tool to sort of 'reset'
  - Asking for help can be hard, especially if you feel you are close to completing the assignment. However, asking for help earlier is always worth the extra hours that might be wasted sticking to said problem.
  - Swapping to another task can also be very useful as it also 'resets' your thought pattern.
