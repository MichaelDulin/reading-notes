My reading journal for Code Fellows

Growth mindset is the ability to understand that intelegence, talent and skill can all be built upon. When facing a challenge, it is the individuals mindset which determines how they go about finding a resolution:
- Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow
- An indivisuals mindset can either be their greatest strength or inhibitor for success
- Intellegence is a skill that can be built upon and is not preordained
