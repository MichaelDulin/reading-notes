**A little about me**

Hey there, my name is Michael Dulin. I am a United States Navy veteran having spent 5 years as a Hosptial Corpsman. Currently enrolled in codefellows, it is my hope that  I can build upon my skillset and secure a career in software development.

## Growth Mindset

Growth mindset is the ability to understand that intelegence, talent and skill can all be built upon. When facing a challenge, it is the individuals mindset which determines how they go about finding a resolution.

Reminders to maintain growth mindset:
- Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow
- An indivisuals mindset can either be their greatest strength or inhibitor for success
- Intellegence is a skill that can be built upon and is not preordained
