**Class 3 Notes**

**Ordered / Unordered Lists**
- 1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
  - When listing things that do not need to be in order 
- 2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
  - CSS: circle, disc, square 
- 3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
  - An ordered list can be used when we are presenting data in a specific order, while unordered is essentialy listing random data  
- 4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
  - type: a(lowercase), A (uppercase), i (lowercase roman numerals), I (uppercase roman numerals), 1 (numbers - defualt)


**The Box Model**

  - All data types
- 2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
  - Yes, it is housing other arrays. We need to parse through each array within the parent array to acces individual data stored (nested for-loop)
- 3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
  - addition assignment (+=), assignment (=), subtraction assignment (-=), division assignment (/=), multiplication assignment (*=)
- 4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
  - Either an error or default to true; cannot perform opperators on different data types
- 5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
  - If its raining, bring a coat. Else, wear a t-shirt
