**First Web Form / How to Structure Web Form**
- 1. Why are forms so important in web development?
  - Forms allow us to retrieve information from users in real time without disrupting their use of the site and we can take this data to change the current site being displayed.
- 2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
  - Where the form is being displayed, how easily the user can access and interact with the form, presenting our data fields with enough context for the user to enter apporpriate responses.
- 3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
  - accept: content the server accepts
  - autocapitalize: automatically capitalizes the text
  - autocomplete: allows forms to fill in the text based off how much the user has already typed in 

**Introduction to Events**
- 1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
  - An event is something we define for something happeneing whether it be a click or submit
- 2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
  - The method in which we define an event (click or submit) and the function which should execute on event
- 3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
  - The values inside the event object define what it is and how it should behave
- 4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
  - Bubble: first runs handlers, then on its parent then all the way up to other ancestors
  - Capture: Not used as often, broken down into 3 steps: capture phase (event goes down to element), target phase (event reached target element), and bubble phase (event bubbles up from element
