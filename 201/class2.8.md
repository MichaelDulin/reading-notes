**Class 8 Notes**

**Learn CSS - Flexbox**
- 1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
  - Flexbox can layout a page either vertically or horizontally, but not both at the same time. We need to create containers to target individual aspects of our site to customize their layout.
- 2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
  - The main access is whichever way we set our flexbox to while the cross axis is always perpindicular to our main axis
- 3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
  - Flexbox adjusts content in a way which can easily be read by web viewers, however, not so much on screen readers


**CSS Layout - Flexbox** 
- 1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
  - Float is either left or right and hard to manipulate after while flexbox allows us to use several different ways to layout content as well as forcing it left or right.
- 2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
  - Understanding the different displays we can use to manipulate our data, flexbox seems to be a critical skill which we should know and can implement into our designs.
