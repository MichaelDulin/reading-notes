**Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites**
1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
  - For storing local user-inputted data and information which on refresh needs to still be accessible by the site
3. What information should not be stored in local storage?
  - Personal information or passwords
5. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
  - Only strings can be stored in local storage, but we can work around that by using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()
