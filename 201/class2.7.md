**Class 7 Notes**

**Domain Modeling**
- 1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
 -  Process of creating conceptual model for a specific task, if modeled well it can help with understanding the problem

**HTML Table Basics** 
- 1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
 - An older way of styling (css was terrible) - used to represent data, not page elements (well)
- 2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
 - <td> table data (smallest), <tr> row (for starting new lines), <th> table header, <col> column (verticle data with same tag)

**Introducing Constructors**
 - 1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
  - A function which creates new objects by defining variables and functions for objects, useful for creating more than one object
 - 2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
  - When used in a constructor this. allows the function to dynamically create objects by refrencing the current objects data being created

**Object Prototypes Using A Constructor** 
- 1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience. (Note: This is a very common front end developer interview question)
 -
