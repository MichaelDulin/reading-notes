**Class 7 Notes**

**Domain Modeling**
- Process of creating a conceptual model (code) for a specidic problem
  - Model:
    - Describes various entities, attributes and behaviors
    - constraints that govern the problem
    - stores data in properties -> encapsulates behavior in methods
    - Referred to as Object-Oriented Model
- Constructor:
  - Houses properties to be inherited 
  - Parameters determine the data used to populate a new object
  - Can house functions, variables, datatypes, etc.
- Instatialization:
  - defines name of new object along with data passed to the constructor 
  - defined by 'new' followed by constructor name
