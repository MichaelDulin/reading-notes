**Class 6 Notes**

**JS Object Basics**
- 1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
  -  An object is a collection and representation of data 
- 2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
  - Used when we want to transder data from one object to a new one, or when we just need to create one static object which values we already know
- 3. How do objects differ from arrays?
  - An array simply houses data. An object houses several types of data and can include functions. Objects are representations of our data
- 4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
  - Useful when an object property name is stored in a variable (cannot use dot notation)
- 5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
  - This. is referring to any function, variable or other data which is in reference to the current object


**Introduction to the DOM** 
- 1. What is the DOM?
  - Document Object Model - programming interface for web documents - a representation of the page which JS (and others) can interact with
- 2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
  - The DOM can be used by JS to interact with the webpage by creating object representations of elements to append the page via programming
